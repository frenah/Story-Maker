# Story-Maker
It makes you a story based on a name, an animal, a food a friend and a ??? that you enter

This is the first proper bit of code I've thought of and worked on. I made it in a day whilst I was sick.
I've uploaded it withiout it being finished. It needs another 16 paragraphs of story, however the concept works.

Concept (and how it works):
Basically, it asigns values between and including 0-4 to all upper and lower case characters.
It then calculates the average value of the combined characters so you enter into a box.
Example: freyja = 0,2,4,4,4,0 which equals 2.3 (lets just call that 2).

MEANWHILE, there are 5 objects, each for each paragraph appended to the page.
Each object has 5 properties.
Each property is a paragraph.
As such, freyja appends the 3rd property of the first story object.

Pretty neat eh?
